# 5x5 Board Game - Run locally 

This turn-based 5x5 board game was developed as part of the HitWicket Software Engineer assignment. Two players compete using 5 pieces each: 3 pawns (P1, P2, P3), 1 Hero1 (H1), and 1 Hero2 (H2).

## Game Rules üìú

### 1. Piece Movement:
- **Pawn (P1, P2, P3):** Moves one block in any direction (L, R, F, B).
- **Hero1 (H1):** Moves exactly two blocks in any straight direction (L, R, F, B) and captures opponent pieces.
- **Hero2 (H2):** Moves exactly two blocks diagonally (FL, FR, BL, BR) and captures opponent pieces.

### 2. Player Interaction:
- Players take turns selecting a piece and moving it using the following commands:
  - **F** (Forward)
  - **L** (Left)
  - **B** (Backward)
  - **R** (Right)
  - **FL** (Forward-Left)
  - **FR** (Forward-Right)
  - **BL** (Backward-Left)
  - **BR** (Backward-Right)
- Each move will be executed, and the board will be updated accordingly.

### 3. Turn Exchange:
- Players alternate turns, with one turn per player.

### 4. Board Updates and Captures:
- The board is updated after each valid move.
- Captures are handled if an opponent's piece is in the path of a Hero piece's movement.

### 5. Move History:
- A move history is maintained and displayed during the game (e.g., "Player A moved P1 Forward").
